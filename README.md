Introduction
The Flask Color Prediction Web App is a simple application built using Flask, a web framework for Python. It demonstrates how to use a pre-trained machine learning model to predict the color of an uploaded image.

Installation
To run the Flask Color Prediction Web App locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/huzaifamalik561/car-color-matching.git)
Install the required Python packages using pip:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have the trained model file trainedmodels.h5 in the same directory as app.py.

Usage
Start the Flask app by running the following command:

bash
python colorapp.py
Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

You will be greeted with a web page where you can upload an image.

Click the "Choose File" button and select an image file you want to predict the color for.

Once the file is selected, click the "Predict" button.

Result
After clicking the "Predict" button, the app will process the uploaded image and display the predicted color on the result page. The predicted color name will be shown along with an option to predict another image.
